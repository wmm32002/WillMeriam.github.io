<center><h1>The Journey Of Will Meriam</h1></center>
	<font color="white"><div><p style="text-indent:40px">When applying to college I wasn't so sure which college I was going to end up at 
	because of the difficulty of getting accepted to certain schools. After recieving my 
	final standardized test grades, I was able to get accepted into all the schools I applied too.
	Finally, what was left was for me to make the desicion about where I was going to spend the next
	4 years of my life.</p></div></font>

	<font color="white"><div><p style="text-indent:40px">The University of Georgia has been a part of my life since I was alittle kid. 
	Being raised by two parents who are die hard UGA fans aswell as alumni, sparked my passion 
	for the bulldogs at a very early age. Attending every home football game since I was a 
	child increased my love for the University, hoping that one day I could follow in my parents 
	footsteps and attend UGA. After being accepted into the University, I didn't have to think twice about 
	where I wanted to go. My parents pushed me throughout my high school career to do really good so I could eventually
	get into UGA and it seemed the workout just fine. I am so glad I decided to come to Georgia and have no regrets so far
	since I have been here.UGA has always been my home and forever will be.</p></div></font>

<h4 style="font-size:160%;">Major and Classes</h4>
<font color="white"><div><p style="text-indent:40px">Coming into school I really didn't know what I wanted to study so I remained undecided until I 
did some more thinking. After some consideration I declared my major as Sports Management. I thought
 that this was the most suitable major for me becuase I love sports and business. I grew up playing 
 sports and was always watching them aswell. My long time goal with this major would to be in the sports marketing business.</p></font>
 
<font color="white"><p style="text-indent:40px">As my sophmore year is about to be half way over, I am soon to finish up my core classes 
and begin taking classes that are more centered around my sports management major. These classses 
that I will be taking next semester will introduce me to what I will be studying the rest of my college career.</P></div></font>
