<h1>The Journey Of Will Meriam</h1>

	<div><p style="text-indent:40px">I am from Suwanee,GA and attended Lambert High school. 

	After spending 4 years at this every academically challenged school, my next step was the figure out what college I was going to attend.</p></div>

	

	<div><p style="text-indent:40px">When applying to college I wasn't so sure which college I was going to end up at 

	because of the difficulty of getting accepted to certain schools. After recieving my 

	final standardized test grades, I was able to get accepted into all the schools I applied too.

	Finally, what was left was for me to make the desicion about where I was going to spend the next

	4 years of my life.</p></div>

<h3 style="font-size:160%;">Why I chose UGA?</h3>

<div style="float:right;"><IMG src='UGAgame.jpg' alt=UGAgame 

 style="width:400px;height:300px"></div>

	<div><p style="text-indent:40px"> The University of Georgia has been a part of my life since I was a little kid. 

	Being raised by two parents who are die hard UGA fans, as well as alumni, sparked my passion 

	for the bulldogs at a very early age. Attending every home football game since I was a 

	child increased my love for the University, hoping that one day I could follow in my parents 

	footsteps and attend UGA. After being accepted into the University, I didn't have to think twice about 

	where I wanted to go. My parents pushed me throughout my high school career to do really well so I could eventually

	get into UGA and it seemed to workout just fine. I am so glad I decided to come to Georgia and have no regrets so far

	since I have been here.UGA has always been my home and forever will be.</p></div>





<h4 style="font-size:160%;">Major and Classes</h4>

<div><p style="text-indent:40px">Coming into school I really didn't know what I wanted to study so I remained undecided until I 

did some more thinking. After some consideration I declared my major as Sports Management. I thought

 that this was the most suitable major for me becuase I love sports and business. I grew up playing 

 sports and was always watching them aswell. My long time goal with this major would to be in the sports marketing business.</p>

 

<p style="text-indent:40px">As my sophmore year is about to be half way over, I am soon to finish up my core classes 

and begin taking classes that are more centered around my sports management major. These classses 

that I will be taking next semester will introduce me to what I will be studying the rest of my college career.</P></div>
